### 💼 Work Experiences

- **Data Science Intern (Full time)** — CardinalHire (Recruiting Tech) <br>
  I identified critical cost and consistency bottlenecks in an LLM-only matching pipeline and engineered a hybrid retrieval prototype ( BM25+ Semantic Search) that demonstrated a 10% accuracy gain and 80% cost-reduction potential. After the company adopted my architectural roadmap, I spent my final quarter securing the production foundation by stabilizing the upstream parsing and normalization layers to ensure high-fidelity data for the new system.
  
- **Data Analyst (Full time)** – Readybloom (E-Commerce)  <br>
  As the first data hire, I established the end-to-end analytical infrastructure by implementing GA4/GTM tracking and automated ETL pipelines. I developed a Marketing-Mix Model (MMM) and a cluster-based retention engine that drove a 600% revenue spike and an 18% lift in repeat purchases, proving the value of data-driven decision-making in an early-stage growth environment.

- **Airport Operations Associate (Full time)** – Korean Air (Loyalty)<br>
  I optimized VIP service operations by analyzing real-time passenger flow data to eliminate bottlenecks and reduce peak wait times by 15%. By standardizing handoff protocols across cross-functional teams, I ensured a seamless end-to-end journey that resulted in a 92%+ customer satisfaction score

- **Marketing Assistant (Full time)** – Seoul Tourism Organization (Public Sector)  <br>
  I tackled the problem of fragmented stakeholder data by integrating diverse datasets into a unified CRM ecosystem, boosting conversion rates by 23%. I also administered $12.7M in city subventions through data-driven reporting and visualization to ensure transparent and efficient management across 130 partners.
